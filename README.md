# UNiq-Public
U-Niq is a code and content library in production for Unreal 5, with some compatibility for Unreal 4. This is a collection of useful scripts I found to be so useful that everyone should have them.

# Usage and Crediting
You can use any of these files in agreement with the terms of the MIT License. It's also nice, but not required, to list me in the credits, by my name (Craig Williams) and optionally, my username (SlashParadox) alongside it.
